INTRODUCTION
Savings App was created for two reasons.
First one is I wanted to have a way to keep tracking of my savings, since I needed to save money for a concert, and I wanted to know how much money I could save (cause it's hard to not to spend it when the cash is available at home lol).
Second one is I wanted to practice react native, since this is my very first react native app and I wanted to make something functional that I would actually use.

TECHNOLOGIES
I made this project using several libraries.
I used datetimepicker from react-native-community.
For the icons, I used a library called vector icons and the material icons library.
I used react navigation for handling my screens and my tab navigator on the app.
MongoDB was my choice here, and for persisting data locally I installed Realm. Setting it up was quite hard for me since sometimes it conflicted with the react navigation library, but I finally managed to make it work.
And finally I used react native gesture handler aswell.

DESIGN 
the app is designed to see and add information within seconds and a few taps, and it's intended to be very user friendly
